Bare <span class="defined">soles<span class="definedtext">Feet touching the earth directly, symbolizing humility and closeness to nature</span></span> in mud, I watch my father <span class="defined">sow<span class="definedtext">Plant seeds into the earth, representing growth, patience, and hope</span></span>,
His hands are <span class="defined">maps<span class="definedtext">Lines and wrinkles that tell stories of labor and time</span></span> of fields that never end.
He hums to <span class="defined">dawn<span class="definedtext">The start of a new day, symbolizing hope and continuity</span></span>, the carabao walks slow,
He calls it <span class="defined">art<span class="definedtext">A craft or act of creation filled with love and meaning</span></span>, the kind the poor defend.

They ride in <span class="defined">cars<span class="definedtext">Modern luxury contrasted with simple living</span></span>, we ride the river’s <span class="defined">bend<span class="definedtext">A curve or turning point in the river’s flow</span></span>.
They feast on <span class="defined">rice<span class="definedtext">A staple food representing sustenance and community</span></span>; we share the grain’s last hue.
Their homes reach <span class="defined">clouds<span class="definedtext">Tall, luxurious dwellings symbolizing excess</span></span>; our walls must twist and <span class="defined">bend<span class="definedtext">Adjust to circumstances, showing resilience</span></span>,
Yet Ma still says, “The sky belongs to you.”

They’d cry if they had seen the <span class="defined">ground<span class="definedtext">The earth they walk on, humble and sustaining</span></span> we tread,
Where <span class="defined">dreams<span class="definedtext">Aspirations of a simple life, or hope despite hardship</span></span> grow thin, and <span class="defined">coins<span class="definedtext">Money, scarcity, and the limits of material wealth</span></span> are cracked in two.
But Pa once said, “The <span class="defined">earth<span class="definedtext">Nature as provider and moral foundation</span></span> is never dead,
Keep planting <span class="defined">love<span class="definedtext">Acts of care, kindness, and ethical living</span></span>, and life will see it through.”

We swim in <span class="defined">pools<span class="definedtext">Small joys and moments of play amid hardship</span></span> that drown our <span class="defined">hut<span class="definedtext">Our humble home, representing simplicity and vulnerability</span></span> from view,
The <span class="defined">flood<span class="definedtext">Challenges or hardships that come repeatedly, yet met with joy</span></span> may return, but the <span class="defined">skies<span class="definedtext">Symbol of hope, constancy, and perspective</span></span>’ still blue.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>
      Grassborne talks about how simplicity can bring about a silent joy. Grassborne lies on the earth itself, happy in its bareness, while Snowchild is frozen, frail and longing in the midst of plenty. It depicts a person who has nothing but is never truly alone; a person who cultivates the same land that others ignore and refers to as paradise. Happiness already exists in the hands of those who live lightly, so it is not necessary to seek it out, as the poem reflects the wisdom of the lowly fisherman. For the persona, every dawn is sufficient, so they don't dream of grandeur. Because they have learned to dance in the flood, they laugh as storms pass rather than because they are spared. A reminder that happiness cannot be purchased, only remembered, Grassborne serves as a gentle protest against greed and dissatisfaction with its rustic imagery and carefree tone. It whispers about the beauty of remaining motionless in a world that is fixated on reaching farther.
