The world stands still, while I bathe in riches.
The crowds <span class="defined">stampede<span class="definedtext">Chaotic rush of desperate people</span></span>, while father puffs a cig.
The children starve, while I ease my itches.
My ears deaf, mouth mute, a red-bow rig.

Ashamed, the better man is in my stand;
Shameless, my young blood reeks of ignorance.
Mother preached every dollar, big or grand,
“Pick them at once, and shall you sing and dance!”

The snow whitewashes my skin– comforting.
I swim in pools of red, all drown 
<span class="defined">yearning<span class="definedtext">Deep longing or desire for something</span></span>.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong> Snowchild tells the story of a child who, despite knowing the family’s corrupt ways, embraces them as his own. In the first stanza, a vivid image of the persona is presented. The persona describes himself as someone whose riches were inherited, not worked for. This motivates the persona to “long for art,” in his twisted way. Art, for the persona, is about riches and power. He sees the world as nothing but a snow-filled wasteland, with his home standing at the center, coated in crimson red, overlooking the former. In the second stanza, the contrast between the lower class and the persona’s family is emphasized, with the last line describing the persona’s lack of empathy for others. The third stanza opens with the persona’s reflection, as he believes that if others were in his stead, they would feel ashamed for the corruption and the lives that it has fallen down upon. The persona responds to this thought with ignorance, choosing personal desires and selfishness over the rights of the people. He attempts to justify his flawed ways by mentioning his mother’s teachings, though this is nothing but a delusional excuse. The last couplet summarizes the persona’s life, with him swimming in pools stained from the blood of those his family has exploited, while the people beneath struggle to stay afloat.
